"""Test-wide setup.

Two things every test process needs, set before anything imports pygame or
matplotlib: a headless display, and a single compute thread per process.

The thread cap matters because the suite runs under ``pytest-xdist``. Each
worker is its own process with its own JAX/XLA runtime, and by default each
would size its thread pool to the whole machine -- so N workers oversubscribe
the box by a factor of N and every one of them slows down. One thread per
worker leaves the parallelism to xdist, which is where it belongs.

# XLA compilation, cached across processes and across runs.

# Profiling the fast job found its cost is not stepping the plants but
# *compiling* them: the four aircraft tuner smoke tests take two gradient steps
# each and still cost 149 s, because reverse-mode through an RK4 aircraft builds
# a large graph, and shrinking the problem to 2 targets and 100 steps barely
# moved them. The graph is the cost, not the rollout.
#
# JAX can persist compiled executables to disk, keyed on the computation itself,
# so the same graph is only ever compiled once. Measured on one of those tests:
# 44.9 s cold, 3.4 s warm. Under xdist every worker is a separate process, so a
# shared directory also stops N workers each compiling the same thing; and in CI
# the directory is restored from the actions cache, which is what makes it a
# once-per-code-change cost rather than a once-per-push one.
#
# Entries are keyed by the jaxpr, the backend and the JAX version, so a stale
# entry is never reused -- a changed computation simply misses.
