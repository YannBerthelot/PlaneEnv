# Learned-policy results

Every environment ships a tuned PID and an MPC upper bound so that a learned
policy has something real to beat. This page is the other half of that
comparison, and the honest state of it is: **the harness is in place and no
results are published yet.**

## Why the numbers live in a file

Training costs GPU-hours, and the answer only moves when the environment or the
agent moves. That is the same shape as the MPC baselines, which were costing
forty minutes of CI on every merge before they were recorded instead of
reproduced, so learned results reuse the mechanism rather than inventing a
second one.

Results go in `data/rl_results.json`, written through
`target_gym.rl_results.record_result`, and the suite checks three things about
each entry: that it is well formed, that it is scored over the environment's own
episode so it sits in the same column as the PID and MPC numbers, and that it
still describes the environment it claims to.

Nothing asserts that RL beats a PID. Whether it does is the question this library
exists to ask, and a test that presumed the answer would be worthless.

## What invalidates a result, and what does not

The guard is `environment_fingerprint`, which is deliberately *narrower* than the
one the shipped baselines use. An agent never calls a PID, so re-tuning a
controller must not throw away a training run that cost GPU-hours. A change to
the dynamics, the reward, the parameters, the integrator or the shared reward
helper must.

This is not hypothetical. Unifying the reward contract across all eighteen
environments invalidated every return-based number in the repository at a
stroke, and the glass furnace's PID moved 3.5% when a boundary bug in its tuner
was fixed. A learned result recorded before either would still be a real
measurement, and would no longer be a statement about this library.

The agent's own configuration -- learning rate, network width, timesteps -- is
stored verbatim and is deliberately *not* fingerprinted: two runs of the same
agent at different hyperparameters are different results, not stale ones, and
both are worth keeping. `tag` separates them.

The experimental design -- which agents, which hyperparameters, how many seeds,
what the expert-based arm actually is -- is fixed in advance in
[the measurement protocol](rl-protocol.md). It is written to be one a reader who
wanted the opposite conclusion would accept.

## Running the training

Training happens outside this package. The dependency runs one way -- from the RL
library to here -- so installing TargetGym never drags in an RL framework, and
there is no cycle to untangle.

[Ajax](https://github.com/YannBerthelot/Ajax) is the intended runner. It is
JAX-native, already depends on this package, and already handles the two things
that would otherwise bias every number on these tasks: termination against
truncation, and preserving the terminal observation at a time-limit truncation
so the value bootstrap is correct. These episodes truncate at `max_steps`
constantly, so getting that wrong would quietly distort every result.

It is also fast in the way this benchmark needs. Ajax's own seed-scaling
measurements on `Plane3DCircle` show 15.8 s for one seed and 18.4 s for a
hundred -- 86x throughput, superlinear, because the fixed compilation overhead
amortises across seeds. That matters here specifically: this project has been
misled by two-seed measurements three separate times, and at those rates ten
seeds is not a budget decision.

```python
# doc: skip -- the call shape; it needs a trained agent's returns to run
from target_gym.rl_results import record_result

record_result(
    env="plane",
    algorithm="SAC",
    library="ajax",
    library_version=ajax.__version__,
    returns=per_seed_episode_returns,   # undiscounted, one per seed
    episode_steps=600,
    total_timesteps=1_000_000,
    config={"n_envs": 64, "lr": 3e-4},
)
```

`returns` must be undiscounted episode returns measured the way the shipped
baselines are. A normalised score or a training curve is not on the same axis as
the numbers it would sit beside, and the suite rejects an episode longer than
the environment's own.

## Reading the result, when there is one

Two failure modes to keep in mind when the table exists.

**If RL loses**, the result is on trial rather than the environments, and the
answer needs to survive "your agent was under-trained". One cross-check against
a standard implementation -- stable-baselines3 is already a dev dependency with
a working PPO smoke test -- on three or four environments settles it. If the two
agree within noise, the JAX numbers inherit that credibility.

**If RL wins**, check what it is beating. The PID is only a fair opponent when it
is tuned, and this library has already shipped one that was not: the glass
furnace's gains sat at the edge of their search grid, and widening it was worth
3.5%. The circle expert could not fly a third of its own task's radius range
until it was allowed to trade speed for turn radius, which was worth 31%. A win
against a baseline with a defect in it is a measurement of the defect.
