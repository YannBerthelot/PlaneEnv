"""
The pygame half of the render kit: everything the aircraft panels share.

:mod:`target_gym.render_kit` is matplotlib, which is what the industrial plants
draw with. The aircraft draw with pygame instead, because they project a solid
model every frame and matplotlib is too slow for that. So they need their own
kit, and this is it: the palette, the console chrome (header strip, gauge
stack, world grid), the A320 mesh and the three projections of it.

It lives here rather than in ``plane3d/rendering.py`` because four modules draw
aircraft -- ``plane3d`` (side and top-down), ``patrol`` (rear and top-down),
``plane/rendering_console.py`` (matplotlib, but flying this same mesh) and
``plane/rendering.py`` -- and until this module existed they reached into each
other for it. ``patrol`` imported eleven private names out of ``plane3d``,
which meant a palette change in one aircraft environment silently restyled
another and nothing said so.

The palette mirrors :mod:`target_gym.render_kit`'s hex constants, lifted a
little: the plants are diagrams on a near-black ground, while these panels are
scenes that need a solid pale aircraft to read against the sky.

Nothing here is fingerprinted. ``provenance._env_sources`` skips ``rendering*``
modules inside an environment package, and this module is not in one, so moving
code between the aircraft renderers never marks a recorded baseline stale.
