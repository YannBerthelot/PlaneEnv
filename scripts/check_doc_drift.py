This suite's contracts are what a reader consults *instead of* the code, so a
stale one does not merely age, it actively misinforms. Reviewing all twenty-one
environments found this to be the most common defect in the repository, and
three of that review's own findings were wrong because of it: a deviation
claiming post-stall lift decays to zero when the fix had long been implemented,
a docstring saying sub-step rewards are summed when the code takes their mean,
and a deviation crediting a reward change to a band the reward does not read.

Four checks, all mechanical. None of them needs judgement, which is the point:
the judgement calls are the ones that rot.
