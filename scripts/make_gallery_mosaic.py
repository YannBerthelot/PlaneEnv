"""Composite environment clips into mosaics, one per registry group.

A row of separate GIFs looks ragged for two reasons that no amount of HTML
fixes: their aspect ratios run from 3.0:1 to 1.87:1, so nothing lines up, and
their frame counts differ (30 to 450), so they drift out of phase and the grid
shimmers. One pre-rendered mosaic solves both -- uniform tiles, a single loop,
and one request instead of twelve.

    uv run python scripts/make_gallery_mosaic.py --set flagship
    uv run python scripts/make_gallery_mosaic.py --set all

``flagship`` is the curated four the homepage carries, one per registry group,
laid out two across so each tile renders at roughly twice the width the old
four-column grid gave it. The group sets are the full gallery, and they are
built *from the registry* rather than from a hand-written list, so an
environment cannot be added without appearing in its group's mosaic.

Writes ``videos/mosaic_<set>.webp``, which is what the README and the
documentation embed, plus a palette-quantised ``.gif`` beside it.

Note that the ``.gif`` is a local convenience only: ``.gitignore`` excludes
``videos/**/*.gif`` apart from ``*_short.gif``, so it is never committed and
therefore never served. It cannot act as a fallback for a reader whose browser
lacks animated WebP -- if that fallback is ever wanted, the ignore rule has to
change first.
