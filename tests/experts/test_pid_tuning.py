"""The gradient PID tuners are runtime, and are reachable automatically.

``experts.pid`` runs ``tune_all_and_save`` whenever ``src/target_gym/data/pid_gains.json`` is
missing, so a user who clears the cache -- or installs without it -- gets these
tuners rather than an error. They had no test at all.

Each tuner is run for a couple of gradient steps: enough to build its loss,
differentiate it and apply an update, which is where the failures live. What is
checked is that the gains that come back are usable numbers, because their
output is cached and then shipped as the environment's baseline.

# overflows float32, ``exp`` returns inf, and the reverse-mode derivative of
# ``x / (1 + inf)`` is NaN even though the forward value is a perfectly good 0.
# Any rollout long enough for the aircraft to depart reached that incidence, so
# every gradient through it came back NaN. Written as ``jax.nn.sigmoid`` -- the
# same function, evaluated stably -- all three pass, which is what this list
# being empty records. It is kept, rather than deleted, because it is where the
